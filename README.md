## 🚀 About Me

I am a **Product Manager** with a technical backbone. I specialize in taking ambiguous business goals and translating them into sharp, execution-ready technical specifications. 

I don't just manage backlogs; I build revenue-generating products. My background allows me to communicate seamlessly with stakeholders on the business side and developers on the technical side, ensuring that **what is sold is what gets built.**

<br/>

*   **Experience:** 7+ years in Product Management, specializing in B2B SaaS and Data-Driven B2C.
*   **Superpower:** Reducing "Time to Value" for MVPs and optimizing conversion funnels using granular data analysis.
*   **Technical Literacy:** I write SQL queries to validate my own hypotheses and use APIs to understand system constraints before writing a single user story.
*   **Methodology:** Agile/Scrum certified, but pragmatic in execution. I value shipping code over perfect documentation.

## 🤝 How I Can Help You

I offer high-impact consulting services for startups and scale-ups. If you are struggling to ship or don't know what to build next, I can help.

### 🎯 **1. The Product Audit (Quick Win)**
A deep dive into your current metrics (GA/Mixpanel) and UX. I will identify the **top 3 bottlenecks** killing your conversion rates and provide a prioritized fix list.

### 🏗 **2. 0-to-1 MVP Strategy**
Have an idea but no roadmap? I will work with you to define the **Minimum Viable Product**, write the technical specs for your developers, and set up your project management infrastructure (Jira/Linear).

### 📈 **3. Fractional CPO / Scaling Strategy**
For teams that need senior leadership without the full-time headcount. I step in to manage the backlog, lead sprint rituals, and align engineering efforts with business KPIs.

## 🧠 My Product Philosophy

I believe in iterative, data-backed development. I don't guess; I measure.
